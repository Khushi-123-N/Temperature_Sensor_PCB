# Temperature Sensor PCB Project (SHT20 + RS485)

This repository is for the design of the **Temperature and Humidity Transmitter PCB**.

The main focus of the project is:
- SHT20 sensor integration
- RS485 communication
- PCB design and layout
- Clearance analysis and finalization

## Day-wise Progress
- Day 1: Requirement Analysis
- Day 2: Schematic Design (block-by-block)
- Day 3: PCB Layout (initial placement & routing)
- Day 4: Clearance Fixes & Adjustments
- Day 5: Final Design & Validation

Each day folder contains a **README.md** documenting the exact work done that day.
