# Day 2: Schematic Design

## Work Done:
- Started schematic design block-by-block
- Designed blocks for interfacing the SHT20 sensor
- Added RS485 communication block
- Confirmed component selection (Resistors, Capacitors, Connectors)
- Reviewed initial schematic connections

## Components Used in Schematic:
- SHT20 Temperature & Humidity Sensor
- RS485 Transceiver (e.g., MAX485)
- Resistors (for pull-ups and general connections)
- Capacitors (decoupling/bypass)
- Connectors/Terminals (for power input and RS485 interface)
