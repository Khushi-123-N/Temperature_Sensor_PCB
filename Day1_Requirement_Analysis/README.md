# Day 1: Requirement Analysis

## Work Done:
- Understood the project objective: Temperature & Humidity Transmitter using SHT20 sensor
- Decided on RS485 communication requirements
- Noted input voltage and power supply specifications
- Initial component selection and interface planning

## Components Selected:
- SHT20 Temperature & Humidity Sensor
- RS485 Transceiver (e.g., MAX485)
- Resistors (for pull-ups and general connections)
- Capacitors (decoupling/bypass)
- Connectors/Terminals (for power input and RS485 interface)

## Notes:
- Initial planning of connections and interfaces done
- Decided where pull-up resistors and decoupling capacitors will be used
