# Day 5: Final Design

## Work Done:
- Finalized the schematic:
  - All components correctly placed
  - All net labels verified: VCC, GND, SDA, SCL, A, B
  - Confirmed connections between sensor, RS485, resistors, capacitors, and connectors
- Finalized PCB layout:
  - Component placement optimized
  - Routing completed for all nets
  - Top and bottom layer tracks verified
  - Clearance and spacing confirmed
- Confirmed routing and component placement:
  - All net labels correct and connected
  - No clearance violations remain
- Design ready for validation and manufacturing

## Notes:
- The PCB design is now fully complete
- All design rules followed
- Ready to generate Gerber files for manufacturing
