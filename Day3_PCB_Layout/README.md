# Day 3: PCB Layout

## Work Done:
- Placed all components on the PCB:
  - SHT20 sensor
  - RS485 transceiver (MAX485)
  - Resistors (pull-ups and general connections)
  - Capacitors (decoupling/bypass)
  - Connectors/Terminals (power input and RS485 interface)
- Started initial routing of PCB tracks
  - Planned top and bottom layer routing
  - Connected all net labels correctly: VCC, GND, SDA, SCL, A, B
- Reviewed rough layout:
  - Checked placement for optimal spacing
  - Ensured minimal crossing of tracks
  - Confirmed correct orientation of components

## Notes:
- Initial PCB layout ready for clearance checking
- Net labels from schematic verified and correctly connected
- Rough routing ensures basic connectivity before final adjustments
