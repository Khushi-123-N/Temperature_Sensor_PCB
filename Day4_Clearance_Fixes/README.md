# Day 4: Clearance Fixes

## Work Done:
- Checked PCB layout for clearance violations:
  - Pad-to-pad spacing
  - Track-to-track spacing
  - Component-to-component spacing
- Adjusted distances between pads to meet design rules
- Modified track widths and spacing for proper current carrying and clearance
- Reviewed updated PCB layout:
  - Top and bottom layer tracks checked
  - Component placement verified
  - Net labels confirmed correct
- Ensured all clearance violations were resolved

## Notes:
- Layout now complies with minimum clearance requirements
- Ready for final design validation and manufacturing preparation
